Hello and welcome to my GitHub page.

My name is Eetu. I gratuated with a bachelors degree in Business Administration back in 2018 but since then I decided that I would like to study myself another degree.
In 2020 I was accepted to study electrical and automation engineering with emphasis on IT-automation.

Im interested in all things back- and front-end development!
So far I have worked with: C#, Java, Python, Javascript, PHP, HTML and CSS, however I am always eager to learn more and new things!
